# nesdev
Some NES stuff: simple gamedev and emulator hacking.

*Yes yes. I know. It's all been done to death before.*

# Goals
A slightly-informed, ordered list of tasks:
1. **Basic NES gamedev** gets me familiar with low-level 6502esque programming, concepts and hardware.
2. **CHIP8 emulation** seems to be the `Helloworld` of emulator projects.
3. **PACMAN game**, because I can't think of a simple game, that's just complicated enough to be challenging.
4. **6502 emulation** should be doable. Opcodes are limited, and the NES gamedev/hardware familiarity will help.
5. **NES emulation** -- this is the final goal. Doesn't need to be cycle-perfect -- just loading and running homebrew roms is enough.
6. **Multiplayer PACMAN**, to flex my average emulation skills.
